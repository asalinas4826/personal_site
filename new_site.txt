To do before site goes live:
- programming portfolio page
- make at least one shrine (St. Joselito or St. Therese)
- put music on site
- write at least one Short Article
- make WIP graphics for everything else
- mobile compatibility

To do after:
- list of English-language monasteries for prayer requests
- anti-dancing article
- RSS Feed
- Feast Day calendar
	- put in your saint, gives you feast days, and dates to start novenas
	- warns you of upcoming feast days
	- all the major saints
		- start w/ the saints of the Roman canon, 14 helpers, Doctors, and Early
			Church Fathers
	- probably all the data would be in a json file or something
		- allow users to add their own saints
			- mark them as "unverified"
			- occasionally go through and verify the list
			- eventually you could get rid of this as no longer necessary
			- oh wait, this would require a dedicated back-end for the json file
	- maybe eventually expose the JSON file to a public API
		- so anybody could use the saint data for themselves
