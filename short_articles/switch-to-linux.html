              Switch to Linux!
            </h3>
            <p>
              In December 2024, at the behest of YouTubers like
              <a href="lukesmith.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-link"
                >Luke Smith</a
              >
              and
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/MentalOutlaw"
                target="_blank"
                class="text-link"
                >Mental Outlaw</a
              >, as well as a personal friend, I installed Arch Linux on my
              personal laptop and began using it for everything that I do.
              Initially, my expectations were low- I thought I was going to
              continue using Windows a lot due to the usability issues I'd heard
              about with Linux. But even though I kept my Windows drive
              connected, expecting fully to dual-boot, I've found that Windows
              has been significantly worse than Linux at literally everything
              that I try to do.
            </p>

              Customizability
            </h3>
            <p>
              Customizability is, for me, at the heart of what makes Linux so
              great. Just head on over to
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn"
                class="text-link"
                >r/unixporn</a
              >
              to see the kinds of hijinks Linux hackers get up to with their
              systems. Here's my desktop set-up:
            </p>
            <img
              id="desktop"
              alt="i3 Arch Desktop"
              src="/resources/images/desktop_screenshot.png"
            />
            <p>
              But it's not just for aesthetics that Linux users customize their
              systems. You can configure pretty much anything you can imagine.
              Do you want a hotkey that automatically pulls up a menu of emojis,
              allows you to select one, and copies it to your clipboard? You can
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCEXY46t3OA"
                class="text-link"
                >do that</a
              >
              . Maybe you're a web developer, and you want a single one-word
              command which will upload your latest changes to the host server
              in an instant. You can
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTnWIKHtOnA"
                class="text-link"
                >do that</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course there are ways to do some of these things on Windows,
              but on Linux it'll be a) much simpler, and b) much faster to set
              up and use.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, I basically don't use a file manager anymore because
              I've configured my terminal to be much faster and easier to use.
              To find a file I just type 'd' and then the file name and my
              terminal instantly finds it, even if I spell the file slightly
              wrong or can't remember the exact name of it. No need to wait for
              File Explorer to slowly open, try the Search function only for it
              to take literal minutes, before giving up and clicking around in
              various directories until I find what I'm looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
              This entire functionality is
              <span style="color: #cc241d">just 1 line of code</span> in my
              '.bashrc' config file.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-section-header">Reliability and Performance</h3>
            <p>
              Linux is much, much faster and much, much smaller than Windows. On
              my set-up, I use maybe 10% of the RAM I used to use on Windows and
              my computer boots much faster (~8 sec compared to 60+ sec on
              Windows- yes, my computer sucks). Even video games native to
              Windows are
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajVvu9M2Y-I"
                class="text-link"
                >now running faster on Linux.</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpbR658ReQg"
                class="text-link"
                >no forced updates</a
              >
              that you have no control over and take forever. On Linux you can
              update whenever you want.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is true that, due to software or firmware compatibility or
              other reasons, Linux on desktop can have stability issues.
              Sometimes I'll update my system and there will be a visual bug or
              something that I have to fix. While this is annoying, it's usually
              a simple fix. Oftentimes, the devs will patch the issue within a
              few days and I don't even have to do anything. Still, it's worth
              keeping in mind, and people using other set-ups may have a
              different experience.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-section-header">Free Software</h3>
            <p>
              The GNU/Linux operating system qualifies as Free Software and is
              directly tied to the
              <a
                href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-intro.html"
                class="text-link"
                >Free software Movement</a
              >. I won't get into the whole philosophy behind the movement, but
              there are a few practical consequences of this which are worth
              getting into here. Basically what all this means is that Linux,
              and much of the software which is made for it, is open-source and
              free for anyone to distribute or edit.
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, Linux, and most of the software associated with
              it, is free of charge, privacy-respecting, and community-oriented.
              Software is free and privacy-respecting because the source code is
              publicly available- anybody can just download it, remove the parts
              they don't like, and then redistribute it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Community members will help report and fix bugs, add features, or
              "fork" the code and make their own versions. Because of this
              dynamic, programs made for Linux are usually much faster, smaller,
              more secure, and better-designed than programs made by
              multi-billion-dollar companies.
            </p>
            <p>
              This also means there is a dedicated community ready to help with
              any questions you might have.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-section-header">Not that hard</h3>
            <p>
              Linux has a reputation of being difficult to use, but I was
              pleasantly surprised at how smooth the process was. I use
              <a href="https://archlinux.org/" class="text-link">Arch Linux</a>
              too, which gives you a very minimal install and expects you to set
              up practically everything yourself. And it still wasn't all that
              hard.
            </p>
            <p>
              But even if you don't wanna use Arch, there are distros like
              <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/" class="text-link"
                >Linux Mint</a
              >
              which are trivial to set up and use. Linux isn't just for
              programmers- anybody with basic competence in using a computer can
              install and learn to use it without much trouble.
